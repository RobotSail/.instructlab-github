# InstructLab

InstructLab is an open source project designed to make model training more open, collaborative and iterative.

InstructLab is based upon a novel synthetic data-based alignment tuning method for Large Language Models (LLMs.) The "**lab**" in Instruct**Lab** stands for **L**arge-scale **A**lignment for Chat **B**ots.

Read more about the method in <https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01081>.
